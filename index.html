            Dr. Ignacio V. Ponseti, an orthopedist whose gentle, nonsurgical method of correcting clubfoot has become the global standard for treatment, helping thousands of children around the world.

        <p id="what-is-clubfoot">
            Clubfoot is a complex, congenital deformity of the foot also known as ‚Äòcongenital talipes equinovarus‚Äô (CTEV) caused by the abnormal development of a baby‚Äôs bones, ligaments and muscles while in the womb. It is one of the most common birth defects affecting some 1 in 1,000 babies. In most cases it is a relatively easy condition to treat. We do not know exactly what causes clubfoot. 
        </p>
        <p id="the-ponseti-method">
            The Ponseti method is a minimally invasive technique for treating clubfoot.  Compared to surgical and other conservative techniques, the Ponseti method has been found to have the best long term outcomes and is considered to be the gold standard for clubfoot treatment. 
            The treatment involves weekly sessions, in which a Ponseti method specialist gently manipulates the baby‚Äôs foot and gradually corrects its position with a series of plaster casts (typically five or six). A tenotomy, a minor operation to release the Achilles tendon, is required in most cases. 
            This can be performed under local anaesthetic in young babies. Following the casting stage, babies are required to wear a special brace (boots and bar) for 23 hours a day for three months, then part-time wear until 5 years of age (overnight and nap time).
            The goal is to provide a long term correction, resulting in a foot that is fully functional, pain-free and suitable for normal shoes.

            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">1914:</span> Ignacio Ponseti was born in 1914 in Menorca, Spain. His family moved to Barcelona when he was 8. He thought his delicate touch might have come in part from his youth there, where he worked with his father, a watchmaker, in Barcelona.</li>
            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">1936:</span> He graduated from the University of Barcelona in 1936 as an MD with a degree in biology (a day before the civil war started). He served as a medic in the Spanish Civil War where he treated as many as 4,000 wounded soldiers, many with broken bones.</li>
            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">1941:</span> Dr. Ponseti then emigrated first to Mexico and then the United States, joining the University of Iowa in 1941.</li>
            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">1948:</span> Dr Ponseti began to develop a serial casting technique to treat clubfoot, He came up with his method after realising that surgery for clubfoot actually did harm. Drawing on his experience tending to the wounded in the Spanish Civil War, he found that a regimen of plaster casts, braces and manipulations by hand could avoid the costs and aftereffects of surgery.</li>
            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">1963:</span> He published his first paper on this non-operative treatment, to widespread criticism and some ridicule.</li>
            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">1984:</span> He returned to clubfoot treatment from retirement, and he later published  ‚ÄúCongenital Clubfoot - Fundamentals of Treatment‚Äù which led to a worldwide revolution in clubfoot treatment.</li>
            <li><span class="ponseti-life-year">2009:</span> Dr. Ponseti continued to treat babies with clubfoot until his death in 2009.</li>

        <p id="ada-story">
            Our daughter, Ada, was born with unilateral talipes affecting one foot (left foot). We found out about her condition during our routine scan at 22 weeks. It was a condition that we had no prior knowledge of and receiving this unexpected news was very frightening. 
            However, meeting with the Ponseti physio team before Ada was even born put our minds at rest and we were able to find out more about this amazing non-invasive treatment called the 'Ponseti Method'. Don't get me wrong, the thought of continuing the treatment until Ada was five was a daunting throught, but we knew, with the support of the fantastic physio team at King's College Hospital, we could fo it üí™üèª
            We also received wonderful support from the charity <a href="https://www.stepsworldwide.org/" target="_blank" id="steps-link">'Steps Worldwide'</a>, who support those whose lives are afected by lower limb conditions.
            Ada is now three years old and thriving!
