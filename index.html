        <h3>What is Talipes/Clubfoot?</h3>
        <p id="what-is-clubfoot">
          Clubfoot is a complex, congenital deformity of the foot also known as
          ‚Äòcongenital talipes equinovarus‚Äô (CTEV) caused by the abnormal
          development of a baby‚Äôs bones, ligaments and muscles while in the
          womb. It is one of the most common birth defects affecting around 1 in
          1,000 babies. In most cases it is a relatively easy condition to
          treat. We do not know exactly what causes clubfoot.

        <h3>The Ponseti Method</h3>
        <p id="the-ponseti-method">
          The Ponseti method is a minimally invasive technique for treating
          clubfoot. Compared to surgical and other conservative techniques, the
          Ponseti method has been found to have the best long term outcomes and
          is considered to be the gold standard for clubfoot treatment. The
          treatment involves weekly sessions, in which a Ponseti method
          specialist gently manipulates the baby‚Äôs foot and gradually corrects
          its position with a series of plaster casts (typically five or six). A
          tenotomy, a minor operation to release the Achilles tendon, is
          required in most cases. This can be performed under local anaesthetic
          in young babies. <br />
          <br />
          Following the casting stage, babies are required to wear a special
          brace (boots and bar) for 23 hours a day for three months, then
          part-time wear until 5 years of age (overnight and nap time). The goal
          is to provide a long term correction, resulting in a foot that is
          fully functional and pain-free.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="ponseti-life-year"><strong>1914:</strong></span>
              Ignacio Ponseti was born in 1914 in Menorca, Spain. His family
              moved to Barcelona when he was 8. He thought his delicate touch
              might have come in part from his youth there, where he worked with
              his father, a watchmaker, in Barcelona.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="ponseti-life-year"><strong>1936:</strong></span> He
              graduated from the University of Barcelona in 1936 as an MD with a
              degree in biology (a day before the civil war started). He served
              as a medic in the Spanish Civil War where he treated as many as
              4,000 wounded soldiers, many with broken bones.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="ponseti-life-year"><strong>1941:</strong></span> Dr.
              Ponseti then emigrated first to Mexico and then the United States,
              joining the University of Iowa in 1941.

            <li>
              <span class="ponseti-life-year"><strong>1948:</strong></span> Dr
              Ponseti began to develop a serial casting technique to treat
              clubfoot, He came up with his method after realising that surgery
              for clubfoot actually did harm. Drawing on his experience tending
              to the wounded in the Spanish Civil War, he found that a regimen
              of plaster casts, braces and manipulations by hand could avoid the
              costs and aftereffects of surgery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="ponseti-life-year"><strong>1963:</strong></span> He
              published his first paper on this non-operative treatment, to
              widespread criticism and some ridicule.

            <li>
              <span class="ponseti-life-year"><strong>1984:</strong></span> He
              returned to clubfoot treatment from retirement, and he later
              published ‚ÄúCongenital Clubfoot - Fundamentals of Treatment‚Äù which
              led to a worldwide revolution in clubfoot treatment.

        <h3>Ada's story</h3>
        <p id="ada-story">
          Our daughter, Ada, was born with unilateral talipes affecting one foot
          (left foot). We found out about her condition during our routine
          ultrasound scan at 22 weeks. It was a condition that we had no prior
          knowledge of and receiving this unexpected news was very frightening.
          However, meeting with the Ponseti physio team before Ada was born put
          our minds at rest and we were able to find out more about this amazing
          non-invasive treatment called the 'Ponseti Method'. Don't get me
          wrong, the thought of continuing the treatment until Ada was five was
          a daunting thought, but we knew with the support of the fantastic
          physio team at King's College Hospital, we could fo it üí™üèª
          <br /><br />
          We are also grateful to the charity

            >Steps Worldwide</a
          >, who support those whose lives are affected by lower limb
          conditions; they put us in touch with another family who had been
          through the treatment process and could share their experiences with
          us. Ada started her tretment at just 2 weeks old and is now over half
          way through her talipes journey. I would also like to dedicate this
          page to her, the bravest little girl I know who does not shy away from
          a challenge! Thanks to Dr Ponseti's pioneering treatment, Ada is now
          thriving!ü¶∂üèª
